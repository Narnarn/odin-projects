<h2>Steps</h2>

    Mix the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg, and
    cabbage in a large bowl.

    Place a teaspoon of filling onto each wonton skin, then moisten the edges
    with water and fold diagonally to create a triangle. Roll the edges to seal
    in the filling. Transfer the dumplings to a lightly floured surface until
    you're ready to cook.

    Arrange the pork dumplings in a steamer so that they're not touching. Steam
    until the pork is cooked through.
