<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion. There are
  never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes, as I think
  the citrusy sauce really makes it. This salad is tastier the longer you can
  let it soak in its juices. I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I
  serve it.
